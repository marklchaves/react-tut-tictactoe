# React Tutorial Tic Tac Toe Game

Based on the Intro to React tutorial on [reactjs.org](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html).

The main differences between this fork with the original code are:

1. There's a **Reset** button that allows you to start a new game with 1 click.
2. The code's been refactored to put the main React components in their own files. There's a utils.js file to keep the SFCs and misc. functions.
3. The main CSS styles come from the [caught my eye dev CSS library](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/marklchaves/cme-styles@1.0.0/dist/cme-styles.min.css).
